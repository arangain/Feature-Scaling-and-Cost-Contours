**Feature Scaling and Cost Contours**

Objectives:
- Demonstrate the importance of feature scaling
- Visualize how feature scaling affects cost contours in gradient descent
- Compare the effects of different learning rates on the convergence of the algorithm

Features:
- Implementation of gradient descent algorithm
- Functions to perform Z-score normalization on dataset features
- Visualizations of unnormalized and normalized data distributions
- Interactive plots showing evolution of cost with iterations of gradient descent
- Predictive modelling using normalized and unnormalized data

Dataset:
- Dataset used includes various features of houses, such as sizes, number of bedrooms, age, and floors. Details on how to access the dataset are in the code provided.

Visualizations:
- Scatter Plots of features against house prices
- Cost function contour plots showing the effect of different scaling methods.
- Predictions versus actual prices to demonstrate model accuracy
